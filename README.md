<h1>🚗 A Whole New Experience: My Car Rental Application! 🚀</h1>

Hello LinkedIn community! Today, I'm thrilled to share with you an exciting new project I've been working on. 🌟

<h2>What Did I Do?</h2>

By combining the power of Next.js and React.js, I transformed the concept of car rental into a modern and user-friendly experience. Developed with TypeScript and JavaScript, the application boasts an aesthetic look thanks to Tailwind CSS. I've considered every detail and prioritized mobile compatibility to ensure everyone can use it comfortably.

<h2>Technological Marvel:</h2>

Choosing MongoDB and Mongoose as the database, I allow users to create and manage profiles, rent out their vehicles, and handle them seamlessly. By using NextAuth for Google login, I'm providing a user-friendly experience.

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Profile Creation and Editing
    </li>
    <li>
       Car Rental and Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Toggle Active/Inactive Status
    </li>
    <li>
        View and Manage Rented Vehicles
    </li>
    <li>
        Google Login and Logout
    </li>
    <li>
        Mobile-Friendly and Responsive Design
    </li>
    <li>
        How Does It Work?
    </li>
</ul>

Users can easily create accounts, rent out their cars, manage them, and edit their profiles at any time. They can showcase or hide their cars by toggling the active or inactive status. Additionally, they can browse other users' profiles to see the cars they've rented.

<h2>Everyone's Invited! 🎉</h2>

I'm excited to share my project with you. Whether you want to rent a car or just take a look, everyone is welcome!
